# Test:

write a RESTful API, available via HTTP

## use case: shopping basket

  * userstory1: "as a customer, I want to add an item into the basket"
  * userstory2: "as a customer, I want to view all my items in my basket"

## expectation:

    please provide the code either in PHP or in Python
    do not invest more than ~3h
    feel free to use any small code libraries you need, but try to avoid the bigger frameworks like Symphony, Laravel, Zend, Django
    you can share the code with us (email / github.com or gitlab.org)
    you share the database structure with us
    implement at least one test
    you explain how you would design the CI/ CD pipeline and the production architecture
        either in written form (use a small chart, name tools, add important notes to each step)
        or implement it in a free CI tool service
    use tools/programming languages you are used to and familiar with

## not expected:
    frontend

# Topics for the follow-up call:

    discussion about the above test-result itself (code and CI/CD pipeline)
    questions regarding operation:
        how to find bottlenecks?
        how to scale the service?
        how "available" is the service?
        how to monitor the service?

To help us reading and understanding your solution you should make it as simple and clear as possible.

We expect the test result within the next 5-7 days. Please prepare yourself and do not hesitate to contact us in case of questions. We will schedule a follow-up call as soon as you hand in the test.
